## ü§î Why Use This Tool

Having Apple's Human Interface Guidelines available as a single, offline PDF provides several benefits:

- **Offline Access**: Access the complete HIG documentation during flights, commutes, or in areas with limited internet connectivity
- **Persistent Reference**: Maintain access to a specific version of the guidelines even if the online documentation changes
- **Improved Navigation**: Quickly search across the entire documentation using PDF reader search functions
- **Annotation**: Add personal notes, highlights, and bookmarks directly on the document

## ‚ú® Features

- Automatically discovers all HIG articles from Apple's developer website
- Generates individual PDFs for each article with proper formatting
- Creates a professional cover page and table of contents
- Merges all PDFs with working bookmarks and internal navigation
- Handles pagination for images and special sections
- Detects and removes duplicate content
- Produces a single, well-structured PDF document

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Playwright

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues and Solutions

### Network and Web Scraping Issues

- **Rate limiting**: The script might be blocked if too many requests are made too quickly. Solution: Add delay between requests or use proxies.
- **Website structure changes**: If Apple updates their website structure, the URL discovery might break. Solution: Update the selectors in `url_discovery.py`.
- **Timeout errors**: Some pages might take too long to load. Solution: Increase timeout values in the code.

### PDF Generation Issues

- **Missing images**: Sometimes images might not load properly. Solution: Increase the wait time for images in `pdf_generator.py`.
- **Rendering inconsistencies**: Different browsers might render content differently. Solution: Adjust the viewport settings or CSS modifications.
- **Memory issues**: Processing many large PDFs can consume significant memory. Solution: Process in smaller batches or increase available memory.

### PDF Merging Issues

- **Bookmark errors**: Incorrect page numbers in bookmarks. Solution: Check the page counting logic in `pdf_merger.py`.
- **Large file size**: The final PDF might be very large. Solution: Adjust the PDF compression settings.
